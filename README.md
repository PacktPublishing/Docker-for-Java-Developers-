# Docker for Java Developers [Video]
This is the code repository for [Docker for Java Developers [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/docker-java-developers-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788629492), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Docker is the world’s leading software container platform. Developers use Docker to eliminate “works on my machine” problems when collaborating on code with co-workers. Docker is a command-line program, a background daemon, and a set of remote services that take a logistical approach to solve common software problems. 

This course starts with the key concepts of containerization and Docker. Next, you’ll see the need for containerization and how Docker is tackling those problems. You will build and monitor the status of containers using the Docker shell, and supervise containers. Then, using a Docker file, you’ll create a simple java application that will be containerized inside Docker. All installation will be easily distributed in a Docker image that contains Java. The final section is dedicated to more advanced use cases, and you’ll see how to automate more complex architectures using Docker.

At the end of the course, you’ll run software in containers and understand why delivering software using containers is a lot faster and more reliable. You’ll know what problems containerization software solves. So, grab this course and build great software with Docker!
